Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. (b) Accordingly, any offeror responding to this solicitation must comply with established HHS EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508. The complete text of the Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines- and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards. (c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are stated in the clause at 352.239- 74, Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility. In order to facilitate the Government\u2019s determination whether proposed EIT supplies meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must submit an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and accessibility standards. The template allows offerors or developers to self-evaluate their supplies and document\u2014in detail\u2014whether they conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard, and any Evaluation Template are available under Section 508 policy on the HHS website http://www.hhs.gov/web/508. In order to facilitate the Government\u2019s determination whether proposed EIT services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must provide enough information to assist the Government in determining that the EIT services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards, including any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues. (d) Respondents to this solicitation must identify any exception to Section 508 requirements. If a offeror claims its supplies or services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and it is later determined by the Government, i.e., after award of a contract or order, that supplies or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense. Note: The HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template (PAT) that is referenced above in 352.239-73 Electronic Information and Technology Accessibility Notice, Paragraph (c), has been replaced with the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template Version (VPAT) 2.1 or later, and is considered to meet HHS PAT requirement.

                "body": "The Government reserves the right to reject any quote that includes any assumption(s) that adversely impact(s) the Government\u2019s requirements or fails to comply with any of the requirements outlined herein. Factor 3 - Past Performance The Offeror\u2019s past performance will be evaluated in accordance with the following Past Performance Relevancy Rating Standards and Performance Confidence Assessments Standards. The Government will conduct a past performance evaluation of the Offeror\u2019s past performance as well as that of its subcontractors (if applicable). Past performance consists of past performance relevancy and performance confidence; thus, the Offeror will be assigned two (2) ratings for past performance: First, the Government will evaluate the Offeror\u2019s past performance references to determine how relevant a recent effort is to the current requirement for source selection. Common aspects of relevance include similarity of service/support, complexity, magnitude of effort, dollar value, and contract type. Second, the Government will evaluate the Offeror\u2019 s past performance to determine the quality of work performed and assess the level of expectation that the Offeror can successfully perform the required effort. Past PastPerformancePerformanceRelevancyRelevancy RatingRatingStandardsStandards Rating Definition Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Performance Confidence Assessment Standards Rating Description Exceptional Confidence Based on the Offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has very high expectations that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Very Good Confidence Based on the Offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has very good expectations that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has reasonable expectations that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Marginal Confidence Based on the offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has minimal expectations that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Unsatisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Unknown Confidence No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror\u2019s performance (Neutral) record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. The evaluation of the VPAT is independent from the other factors and will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Offeror to meet the requirements of all the applicable Section 508 standards as listed in HHSAR clause 352.239-74 Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility. Alternatively, Offerors may propose goods or services that provide equivalent facilitation. Such offers will be considered to have met the standards of the Access Board\u2019s standards for the feature or component providing equivalent facilitation. If none of the Offerors propose goods or services that fully meet all of the applicable Access Board\u2019s standards, those Offerors whose products or services meet some of the applicable standards will be considered eligible for award. ICT vs. EIT Procurement documentation from HHS or other agencies may contain references to \u201cEIT\u201d (Electronic and Information Technology) and \u201cICT\u201d (Information and Communications Technology). HHS considers these terms to be interchangeable, and \u201cEIT\u201d should always be interpreted to be \u201cICT\u201d in any HHS procurement. The Section 508 VPAT will be evaluated as described in this chart. ICT Products fully meet intent of all applicable Section 508 Standards. Risk Green of failure to meet all Section 508 Requirements is very low. ICT Products can be made capable of meeting the intent of all applicable products. Risk of failure to meet all Section 508 Requirement is low. Standards or the VPAT is materially incomplete. Risk of failure to meet all Red",
