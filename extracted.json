It allows multiple users to contribute, create, edit, and publish content without needing to have a web development skillset. It can also provide version management and authoring workflow to keep webpages consistent. Historically, management of the Invasive Carp website has suffered from complex content entry procedures and bottlenecks due to lack of resources/expertise in managing html. The rebuild of this site in a modernized content management system aims to achieve a straightforward content entry workflow that can be easily adopted and improve upon prior challenges of managing the site.",

It is anticipated that the effort will start off with a design review of the legacy site, to determine if and where it may make sense to pursue any notable changes during the rebuild. The current organization and structure of the site is well liked by its heaviest users, but the group remains open to suggestions on how to improve the user experience and how to best build upon the foundation that exists. Once there is an agreed upon strategy for the site rebuild and any design adjustments coming into play, the contractor would move forward into development and further migration efforts. The site currently houses and will continue to house the following types of content/pages (not exclusively limited to): 1. Background Info/About Us 2. Plans and Report library (documents) 3. Newsroom/News archive 4. Outreach and Resource materials 5. Species Profiles (4 carp species) 6. FAQ It is anticipated that FWS and the partnership organization resources will manage an overwhelming majority of the written content development and migration for the site, while the contractor will be expected to facilitate migration of document and media assets where logical.",

Content entry forms should be configured with ease of use/simplicity as a priority",
