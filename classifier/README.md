# SetFit with sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

This is a [SetFit](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit) model that can be used for Text Classification. This SetFit model uses [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) as the Sentence Transformer embedding model. A [LogisticRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) instance is used for classification.

The model has been trained using an efficient few-shot learning technique that involves:

1. Fine-tuning a [Sentence Transformer](https://www.sbert.net) with contrastive learning.
2. Training a classification head with features from the fine-tuned Sentence Transformer.

The boundaries of this project are strictly limited to the five source systems listed in Appendix A; integrating additional data sources is considered out of scope and must be handled through a separate change request.'</li><li>'Initiative Scope and Boundaries\nThe scope of work for this engagement includes a full security audit of all public-facing web applications and the internal network. This involves vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and social engineering exercises. The project is explicitly bounded to the corporate network within the North American data centers and will not extend to third-party vendor systems or recently acquired international subsidiaries, which are under a separate assessment program.'</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Technologies - This section specifies the tech stack - the environment, technologies, platforms, software, or tools that will be used or required for the project. | <ul><li>'Technical Approach for Hypothetical #1, Cloud Readiness and Enhancements - 10 points\nHRSA Test Harness is an Enterprise Test Automation Platform that standardizes automated testing processes and promotes collaboration across multiple vendors to support the HRSAs IT mission. The framework supports industry standard testing methodologies such as Data Driven Testing (DDT) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It provides an interface to users to define workflows to automate functional testing for an application. These workflows can then be executed against various environments as the software propagates from lower environments to higher ensuring the integrity and quality of the software product. The solution provides the capability for users to create test suites within the application UI with little or no coding. The configured test suites can then be executed either on demand or on a schedule in any given environment. All tests provide detailed reports that allows the user to identify potential defects with the product(s) being tested. The Test Automation Framework natively integrates with enterprise products like Jira for incident management, Jenkins for CI/CD, JMeter for performance testing, and RedGate for test data generation. Refer all the relevant documents such as architecture, tools and technologies and technical design documents while responding to this hypothetical project. Current Challenges Current Test automation Test automation framework is designed to support and implement the automation tests for EHBs. Solution shall consider refactoring / Re-engineering the existing Test automation framework for cloud adoption and readiness. Proposed solution shall also consider  disaster recovery, loosely coupled architecture for APIs, Test Framework execution by bureaus in a containers, incremental modernization, maintaining backward compatibility until the system is fully modernized and migrated, system performance, scalability and cost savings in cloud space using the combination of Infrastructure as Service (IaaS), Platform as Service (PaaS) and Software as Service (SaaS).
