The Government will conduct a past performance evaluation of the Offeror\u2019s past performance as well as that of its subcontractors (if applicable). Past performance consists of past performance relevancy and performance confidence; thus, the Offeror will be assigned two (2) ratings for past performance: First, the Government will evaluate the Offeror\u2019s past performance references to determine how relevant a recent effort is to the current requirement for source selection. Common aspects of relevance include similarity of service/support, complexity, magnitude of effort, dollar value, and contract type. Second, the Government will evaluate the Offeror\u2019 s past performance to determine the quality of work performed and assess the level of expectation that the Offeror can successfully perform the required effort. Past PastPerformancePerformanceRelevancyRelevancy RatingRatingStandardsStandards Rating Definition Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

Performance Confidence Assessment Standards Rating Description Exceptional Confidence Based on the Offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has very high expectations that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Very Good Confidence Based on the Offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has very good expectations that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has reasonable expectations that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Marginal Confidence Based on the offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has minimal expectations that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Unsatisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror\u2019s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Unknown Confidence No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror\u2019s performance (Neutral) record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. The evaluation of the VPAT is independent from the other factors and will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Offeror to meet the requirements of all the applicable Section 508 standards as listed in HHSAR clause 352.239-74 Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility. Alternatively, Offerors may propose goods or services that provide equivalent facilitation. Such offers will be considered to have met the standards of the Access Board\u2019s standards for the feature or component providing equivalent facilitation. If none of the Offerors propose goods or services that fully meet all of the applicable Access Board\u2019s standards, those Offerors whose products or services meet some of the applicable standards will be considered eligible for award. ICT vs. EIT Procurement documentation from HHS or other agencies may contain references to \u201cEIT\u201d (Electronic and Information Technology) and \u201cICT\u201d (Information and Communications Technology). HHS considers these terms to be interchangeable, and \u201cEIT\u201d should always be interpreted to be \u201cICT\u201d in any HHS procurement.

It provides an interface to users to define workflows to automate functional testing for an application. Built in selenium actions to support wide range HTML controls within EHBs. The Test Automation Framework natively integrates with enterprise products like Jira for incident management, Jenkins for CICD, JMeter for performance testing, and RedGate for test data generation.  Current Challenges How to increase predictive defect analysis to identify dependencies and patterns to ultimately produce recommendations or provide a business with insights, thus contributing to data-driven decision- making. User Interface visual testing is a coverage gap in the current regression test suites. Exposure for visualization related defects getting promoted to production and resulting the inconsistency across the modules, which is impacting end-user experience and overall customer satisfaction.
