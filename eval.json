The framework supports industry standard testing methodologies such as Data Driven Testing (DDT) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It provides an interface to users to define workflows to automate functional testing for an application. These workflows can then be executed against various environments as the software propagates from lower environments to higher ensuring the integrity and quality of the software product. The solution provides the capability for users to create test suites within the application UI with little or no coding. The configured test suites can then be executed either on demand or on a schedule in any given environment. All tests provide detailed reports that allows the user to identify potential defects with the product(s) being tested. The Test Automation Framework natively integrates with enterprise products like Jira for incident management, Jenkins for CI/CD, JMeter for performance testing, and RedGate for test data generation. Refer all the relevant documents such as architecture, tools and technologies and technical design documents while responding to this hypothetical project. Current Challenges Current Test automation Test automation framework is designed to support and implement the automation tests for EHBs.

Proposed solution shall also consider  disaster recovery, loosely coupled architecture for APIs, Test Framework execution by bureaus in a containers, incremental modernization, maintaining backward compatibility until the system is fully modernized and migrated, system performance, scalability and cost savings in cloud space using the combination of Infrastructure as Service (IaaS), Platform as Service (PaaS) and Software as Service (SaaS). HRSA is also looking for a riskless migration path to modernize the system in specified duration without impacting business and performance of the current system. Please describe your strategy and approach for Cloud readiness and modernization. Specifically, the Offeror shall address the following requirements: \uf0b7 Review and provide the strategy for cloud adoption and readiness. \uf0b7 Propose the Cloud readiness architecture for all the core components of test harness. The modernization strategy should align with continuous delivery principles. \uf0b7 Enhance Test Harness platform to natively support cloud API testing and provision for third party tools integration \uf0b7 Create service containers for portability, management and test execution. \uf0b7 Ensure Data integrity and protection during transit and at rest. \uf0b7 Cloud adoption strategy should include o Configure auto scaling for performance and maximum throughput o Monitor, measure and Enhance security posture for cloud adoption \uf0b7 Interfaces and systems need to be covered while planning the cloud migration o Detect coordination problems in cloud environment \u2013 this is to ensure the applications are well configured with cloud environment",
