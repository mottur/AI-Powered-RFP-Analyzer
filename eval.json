The scope of work includes requirements gathering, data pipeline development, warehouse design, and dashboard creation. The project assumes that source system owners will provide timely access to data and subject matter experts. The boundaries of this project are strictly limited to the five source systems listed in Appendix A; integrating additional data sources is considered out of scope and must be handled through a separate change request.",
