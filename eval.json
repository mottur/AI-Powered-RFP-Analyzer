Legislative and business policy changes trigger frequent releases, causing challenges in verification and validation activities. Current Challenges In an agile business environment, system changes are required to release every week to support the legislative mandate.

Once there is an agreed upon strategy for the site rebuild and any design adjustments coming into play, the contractor would move forward into development and further migration efforts. The site currently houses and will continue to house the following types of content/pages (not exclusively limited to): 1. Background Info/About Us 2. Plans and Report library (documents) 3. Newsroom/News archive 4. Outreach and Resource materials 5. Species Profiles (4 carp species) 6.
