Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. (b) Accordingly, any offeror responding to this solicitation must comply with established HHS EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508. The complete text of the Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines- and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards. (c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are stated in the clause at 352.239- 74, Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility. In order to facilitate the Government\u2019s determination whether proposed EIT supplies meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must submit an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and accessibility standards. The template allows offerors or developers to self-evaluate their supplies and document\u2014in detail\u2014whether they conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard, and any Evaluation Template are available under Section 508 policy on the HHS website http://www.hhs.gov/web/508. In order to facilitate the Government\u2019s determination whether proposed EIT services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must provide enough information to assist the Government in determining that the EIT services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards, including any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues. (d) Respondents to this solicitation must identify any exception to Section 508 requirements. If a offeror claims its supplies or services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and it is later determined by the Government, i.e., after award of a contract or order, that supplies or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense. Note: The HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template (PAT) that is referenced above in 352.239-73 Electronic Information and Technology Accessibility Notice, Paragraph (c), has been replaced with the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template Version (VPAT) 2.1 or later, and is considered to meet HHS PAT requirement.

The framework supports industry standard testing methodologies such as Data Driven Testing (DDT) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It provides an interface to users to define workflows to automate functional testing for an application. These workflows can then be executed against various environments as the software propagates from lower environments to higher ensuring the integrity and quality of the software product. The solution provides the capability for users to create test suites within the application UI with little or no coding. The configured test suites can then be executed either on demand or on a schedule in any given environment. All tests provide detailed reports that allows the user to identify potential defects with the product(s) being tested. The Test Automation Framework natively integrates with enterprise products like Jira for incident management, Jenkins for CI/CD, JMeter for performance testing, and RedGate for test data generation. Refer all the relevant documents such as architecture, tools and technologies and technical design documents while responding to this hypothetical project.
